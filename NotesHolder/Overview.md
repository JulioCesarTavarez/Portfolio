# Overview

Okay in this file I wanted to make a webpage that would hold notes for a user. create a note give it a title and then
type notes then if you hit the read more or open buton it will open the page and the notes can be modified or just read.
Then if we didnt want to make any changes we could hit the x in the top right corner. this will intern leave the notes alone.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

okay this webpage can open up notes and you can have multiple notes making it so that you can have as many pages as you have storage on your computer.

# Development Environment

okay using vsCode, I am using 1 a json file to store the sticky notes. 2 I am using html and css to have the webpages be styled and formatted.
3rd I am using javascrypt to make the pages responsive. and make more note pages as you creat them.

- first I want to finish the delete button
- I also want the background ot be blurry when we open up a sticky note so that way we focus on just the open note
